Hello, 
I'm Brian. I'm an aspiring Penetration Tester with a strong desire to learn as much as I can. I started this blog mainly for write-ups on CTF's, and also to document my journey into Infosec. I'm currently focusing on [Hackthebox](http://hackthebox.eu/) as a means of preparing myself for the OSCP. 
Feel free to follow me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/brian-manuel-b58987138) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ping_of_death_).

Thanks for reading!
<br>
-B
